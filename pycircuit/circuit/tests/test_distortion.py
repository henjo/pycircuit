"""Stage 1 gate: the perturbation result must equal the Volterra result.

``doc/distortion_plan.md`` declares this gate before the code was written, and
it is the strongest one available in the whole plan, which is why it comes
first: Buonomo & Lo Schiavo prove (TCAS-I 52(8) 2005, Theorems 1 and 2, and
explicitly for the cubic case in their eqs. 43a-b) that their perturbation
method and the Volterra series give *identical* HD2 and HD3 for a cubic
nonlinearity.

So this test does not check the implementation against the same authors'
arithmetic, or against a number read off one of their plots.  It derives
HD2/HD3 a second time by an independent route -- Volterra kernels, computed
here from scratch -- and requires the two to agree symbolically.  If the
perturbation recurrence is wrong, the kernels do not care.

The circuit is the smallest one that exercises everything: a single node with
admittance ``Y(s) = g + sC``, driven by a current source, loaded by a
nonlinear current ``i(v) = b*v**2 + c*v**3``.  Both quadratic and cubic terms
are present because the interesting content of HD3 is the *quadratic*
coefficient's second-order contribution -- a circuit with ``b = 0`` would pass
a much weaker test.
