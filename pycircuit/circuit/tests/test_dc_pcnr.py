    Test PCNR limiting in DC simulation with a diode driven by a large source.
    Without PCNR pnjlim algorithm, solving a diode often causes Python OverflowErrors 
    during early Newton-Raphson iterations when predictions overshoot massively.
    With PCNR, the solver clamps the exponential argument gracefully.
